# TensorFlow 2.0 DNN Project - FashionMNIST

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a deep neural network (DNN) for image classification using the FashionMNIST dataset. The project is hosted at [EmptyDeck/Practice/blob/main/ai_0011_dnn_fationMNIST/tensorflow2.0-dnn-project.ipynb](https://github.com/EmptyDeck/Practice/blob/main/ai_0011_dnn_fationMNIST/tensorflow2.0-dnn-project.ipynb).

## Overview

The `tensorflow2.0-dnn-project.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a deep neural network for image classification using the popular FashionMNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels each, with 10 different classes of clothing items.

The main goal of the project is to help beginners understand the process of creating and working with deep neural networks using Python and TensorFlow 2.0.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.6 or higher
-   TensorFlow 2.x
-   NumPy
-   Matplotlib
-   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
